Currently this is one of the biggest requests that are made for this plugin and the author has pointed out that they are concentrating on anti-griefing aspect of GPP and that the API is there for anyone that wants to help extend the project! Originally the was started by leezallen and continued by SuperPyroManiac and MrCaira. This version is compatible with GPP only.
